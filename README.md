# Survey Form

A Survey Form That I Made To Learn Css Concepts

## What I Learned

1. How To Make Custom CheckBox.
2. About Css Positioning.
3. How To Bind Checked Event To `Label` (give `checkbox` an `id` and in `Label` set `for` attribute to that `id` , now we can check the checkbox by clicking anything that is inside the `Label`).
